# Core application framework
streamlit

# OpenAI API for translation
openai

# Video and audio processing
moviepy==1.0.3

# Transcription model and dependencies
openai-whisper
# IMPORTANT: To use CUDA (using GPU instead of CPU for transcription) use a compatible CUDA torch build for example: pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
torch
torchvision
torchaudio

# Numerical processing (often a dependency, good to include)
numpy

# Note: This file lists Python packages installable via pip.
# You ALSO need to manually install the following external software
# and ensure they are in your system's PATH or configured correctly:
# 1. FFMPEG (required by moviepy for video/audio operations)
# 2. ImageMagick (required by moviepy for text rendering/subtitles,
#    ensure moviepy can find it via PATH or IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY env var)
